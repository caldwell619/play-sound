# Play Sound

A simple script that plays an mp3 file of your choosing.

## Setup

The setup is pretty minimal. 

### Dependencies

To install the necessary packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will add:

- `Click`

### Adding your own sound files

To add any sound bits for functionality, add them to the `assets/` folder.

To use them in the application, simply add the string path to `sound_list.py`
